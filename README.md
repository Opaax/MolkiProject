# Molkky Project

With my family we often play Molkky. Never found a great app to count our score. We made a physical score counter with pearls.

meanwhile, I did, and yet not done:

-Solo game (solo mean free for all)
  - adding/removing player
  - start game
  - count points and miss (WIP)
  - Some UI effect
-Team game
  - I saw in the offical rules there a team game, I looking to develop this too
- Rules menu
