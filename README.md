# Molkky Project

With my family, we often play Molkky. Never found a great app to count our score. We made a physical score counter with pearls.

meanwhile, I did this project and yet not done:

- Solo game (solo mean free for all)
1. adding/removing the player
2. start the game
3. count points and miss (WIP)
4. Some UI effect
   
- Team game
1. I saw in the official rules there is a team game, I looking to develop this too

- Rules menu
